Charge Account Validation

Create a class with a method that accepts a charge account number as its argument. 
The method should determine whether the number is valid by comparing it to the following list of valid charge account numbers:

5658845 4520125 8080152 4562555 1005231 6545231

7895122 8777541 5552012 5050552 3852085 7576651

8451277 7825877 7881200

1302850 1250255 4581002



These numbers should be stored in an array or an ArrayList object. Use a sequential search to locate the number passed as an argument. If the number is in the array, the method should return true, indicating the number is valid. If the number is not in the array, the method should return false, indicating the number is invalid.

Write a program that tests the class by asking the user to enter a charge account number. The program should display a message indicating whether the number is valid or invalid.
